# Challenge-10 Climate Analysis API

##Project Overview

###The Climate Analysis API is a dynamic web application designed to deliver valuable insights into historical climate data from Hawaii. Built with Flask and SQLAlchemy, this API serves as a gateway to access and analyze patterns in precipitation, temperature observations, and weather station activity over the last year of available data. It is intended for environmental researchers, data scientists, and climate enthusiasts who are interested in understanding weather trends in Hawaii.

##Features and Functionalities
Historical Precipitation Data: Users can query precipitation data for the past year, allowing for analysis of seasonal weather patterns and rainfall trends.
Station Information: The API provides comprehensive details on weather stations, aiding studies that require understanding geographic distribution and station-specific data.
Temperature Observations: Focused on the most active weather station, this feature offers temperature data for the past year, which is crucial for climate variation and change analysis.

##Getting Started
###Prerequisites
This application is built in Python, utilizing several libraries for web serving and data handling. Users will need Python installed, along with Flask for creating the web server, and SQLAlchemy for database management. Additional libraries such as numpy may also be required for certain data manipulations.
